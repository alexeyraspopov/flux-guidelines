# Introduction

> Our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and that
> our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly

> program (spread out in text space) and the process (spread out in time) as
> trivial as possible.

This guideline aims at fulfilling the missing part of docs, describing the way
how developers can solve their problems. Starting from basics, it covers whole
path from project bootstrap step to the most common tasks that a developer
solves on daily basis.

Instead of covering only theoretical part of the subject, diving into
philosophy of programming, fighting for purity and using subjective evaluation
metrics, this guideline is focused on describing how exactly Flux solves common
tasks and keeps a project consistent, ready for scaling and friendly for new
developers.
