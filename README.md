# Flux Guidelines

A set of guides for building scalable single-page web applications using
unidirectional data flow.

The guides are based on [Facebook's Flux][1] implementation. The examples of UI
code are written in [React][2] however Flux can be used with any other UI layer
implementation.

## Table of contents

 * [Introduction](./Introduction.md)
 * [Glossary](./Glossary.md)
 * [Structure](./Structure.md)
 * [Testing](./Testing.md)
 * [Logging](./Logging.md)

When it comes to development tools configuration, the guides are referring to
[Create React App][3] as a base tool with all the batteries included. This
helps staying focused on the topic and don't repeat guides for a particular
tool which eventually becomes outdated. All examples described in JavaScript
using ES2017. In case you're not familiar with the features in the newest
standards, it's better to start with [Exploring JS][4] project.
