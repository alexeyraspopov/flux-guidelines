# Flux Guidelines / Introduction

> Our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and that
> our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly
> developed. For that reason we should do (as wise programmers aware of our
> limitations) our utmost to shorten the conceptual gap between the static
> program and the dynamic process, to make the correspondence between the
> program (spread out in text space) and the process (spread out in time) as
> trivial as possible.
